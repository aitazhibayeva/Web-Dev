    <h1>A Girl by Ezra Pound</h1>
    <p>The tree has entered my hands,<br>
    The sap has ascended my arms,<br>
    The tree has grown in my breast-<br>
    Downward,<br>
    The branches grow out of me, like arms.<br><br>
    Tree you are,<br>
    Moss you are,<br>
    You are violets with wind above them.<br>
    A child - so high - you are,<br>
    And all this is folly to the world.</p>

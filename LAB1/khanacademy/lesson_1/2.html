        <strong>Nobody’s</strong> born smart. We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do
            algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. </em><strong>Nobody’s</strong> good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to <strong>10</strong>.<br>
        <strong>And Shakespeare had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
        <em><strong>Thankfully</strong>, we are born to learn.<br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br></em>
        <strong><em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em></strong><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on <strong>top</strong> of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</em><br>
        <em><strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.</em>
        Because the most <strong>beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe</strong><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>

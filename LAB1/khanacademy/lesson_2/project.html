    <h1><strong>Travel to Kazakhstan</strong></h1>
    <p id="introduction"><strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a landlocked country mostly in Central
        Asia, with a small part in Eastern Europe. It borders Russia to the north and west, China to the east,
        Kyrgyzstan to the southeast, Uzbekistan to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southwest, with a coastline along
        the Caspian Sea. Its capital is Astana, while the largest city and leading cultural and commercial hub is
        Almaty.</p>

    <p class="text"> <em><strong>Kazakhstan</strong> is the world's ninth-largest country by land area and the largest landlocked country.</em> It
        has
        a population of 20 million and one of the lowest population densities in the world, at fewer than 6 people per
        square kilometre (16 people/sq mi).[13] Ethnic Kazakhs constitute a majority, while ethnic Russians form a
        significant minority. Officially secular, Kazakhstan is a Muslim-majority country, although ethnic Russians in
        the country form a sizeable Christian community.</p>

    <p class="text"><strong>Kazakhstan</strong> is a transcontinental country mostly in Asia with a small western part across the Ural
        River in Europe. It has borders with the Russian Federation in the north and west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
        Tajikistan in the southwest, and China in the far east. The northern border is mostly with Siberia, Russia, so
        Russia has the longest border with Kazakhstan.[10] Basically, Kazakhstan runs from the Caspian Sea in the west
        to the mainly Muslim Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. Kazakhstan has no ocean shoreline, but borders the
        Caspian Sea, which boats use to get to neighboring countries. The Caspian Sea is an Endorheic basin without
        connections to any ocean.</p>
